Fall detection using floor sensors

The fall detection system consists of pressure sensors, a amplifier, a MCU, and a host PC. The pressure sensors will collect the raw data, and the MCU will transmit the data to the host PC. On the host PC, a data cleaning pipeline will extract the useful signal from the raw data, and the pre-trained machine learning algorithms
